# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# user = User.create( city: "Seattle", img_url:"https://bardbehavioralhealth.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/create-a-gravatar-beard.png", username:"Gabriel", password:"12345")
